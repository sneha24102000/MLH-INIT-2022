Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.

Key elements of a blockchain-
1)Distributed ledger technology
2)Immutable records
3)Smart contracts


Benefits of blockchain-
1}Greater trust
2}Greater security
3}More efficiencies

How blockchain works-
1)As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data.
2)Each block is connected to the ones before and after it
3)Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain

Types of blockchain networks-
1)Public blockchain networks
2)Private blockchain networks
3)Permissioned blockchain networks
4)Consortium blockchains
